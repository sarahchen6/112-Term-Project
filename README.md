Hello and welcome to Ho Ho Home: the Santa Maze Game!

Game Description
    Players will begin by being given the Christmas-themed background story and 
    instructions. From there, players will choose a sled based on what features 
    of the game they want to play with and then enter the sledâ€™s respective mode. 
    Though each mode has different features (e.g. compromised visibility or a 
    pathfinding Grinch), the ultimate goal for each is still the same - solve the 
    maze as quickly and accurately as possible. Players lose 10 presents every 
    minute it takes them to solve the maze, and the final screen will display how 
    many presents out of 100 they were able to deliver. A "telephone line" can be 
    called where the solution path is revealed through a series of dots.
